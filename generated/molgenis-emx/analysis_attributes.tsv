physicaldatalocation	Physical data location	A place on the Earth where the data is located, by its name or by its geographical location. This definition is intentionally vague to allow reuse locally (e.g. which computer), for contacting (e.g. which institute), broadly for logistical or legal reasons (e.g. city, country or continent).

bioinformaticprotocoldeviation	Bioinformatic protocol deviation	A variation from processes or procedures defined in the bioinformatic protocol.
