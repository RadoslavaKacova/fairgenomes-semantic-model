sequencingidentifier	Sequencing identifier	A unique identifier assigned to raw data from a performed nucleic acid sequencing assay.	sequencing	string	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	
belongstosample	Belongs to sample	Link to the prepared sample i.e. source that was sequenced.	sequencing	xref	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE	fair-genomes_samplepreparation
sequencingdate	Sequencing date	Date the sequencing run was performed.	sequencing	date	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE	
sequencingplatform	Sequencing platform	A sequencing plaform (brand) is a name of a company that produces sequencer equipment.	sequencing	xref	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE	fair-genomes_sequencing_sequencingplatform
sequencinginstrumentmodel	Sequencing instrument model	A product name and model number of a manufacturer's genomic (dna) sequencer.	sequencing	xref	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE	fair-genomes_sequencing_sequencinginstrumentmodel
sequencingmethod	Sequencing method	Method used to determine the order of bases in a nucleic acid sequence.	sequencing	xref	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE	fair-genomes_sequencing_sequencingmethod
averagereaddepth	Average read depth	The average number of times a particular locus (site, nucleotide, amplicon, region) was sequenced.	sequencing	int	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE	
observedreadlength	Observed read length	The number of nucleotides successfully ordered from each side of a nucleic acid fragment obtained after the completion of a sequencing process.	sequencing	int	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE	
observedinsertsize	Observed insert size	In paired-end sequencing, the DNA between the adapter sequences is the insert. The length of this sequence is known as the insert size, not to be confused with the inner distance between reads. So, fragment length equals read adapter length (2x) plus insert size, and insert size equals read lenght (2x) plus inner distance.	sequencing	int	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE	
percentageq30	Percentage Q30	Percentage of reads with a Phred quality score over 30, which indicates less than a 1/1000 chance that the base was called incorrectly.	sequencing	decimal	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE	
percentagetr20	Percentage TR20	Percentage of the target sequence on which 20 or more unique reads were successfully mapped.	sequencing	decimal	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE	
otherqualitymetrics	Other quality metrics	Other NGS quality control metrics, including but not limited to (i) sequencer metrics such as yield, error rate, density (K/mm2), cluster PF (%) and phas/prephas (%), (ii) alignment metrics such as QM insert size, GC content, QM duplicated reads (%), QM error rate, uniformity/evenness of coverage and maternal cell contamination, and (iii) variant call metrics such as number of SNVs/CNVs/SVs called, number of missense/nonsense variants, common variants (%), unique variants (%), gender match and trio inheritance check.	sequencing	text	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE
