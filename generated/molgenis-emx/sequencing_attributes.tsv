sequencinginstrumentmodel	Sequencing instrument model	The used product name and model number of a manufacturer's genomic (dna) sequencer. (GENEPIO:0001921)	sequencing	xref	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE	fair-genomes_sequencing_sequencinginstrumentmodel
sequencingmethod	Sequencing method	Method used to determine the order of bases in a nucleic acid sequence. (FIX:0000704)	sequencing	xref	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE	fair-genomes_sequencing_sequencingmethod
averagereaddepth	Average read depth	The average number of times a particular locus (site, nucleotide, amplicon, region) was sequenced. (NCIT:C155320)	sequencing	int	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE	
observedreadlength	Observed read length	The number of nucleotides successfully ordered from each side of a nucleic acid fragment obtained after the completion of a sequencing process. (NCIT:C153362)	sequencing	int	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE	
observedinsertsize	Observed insert size	In paired-end sequencing, the DNA between the adapter sequences is the insert. The length of this sequence is known as the insert size, not to be confused with the inner distance between reads. So, fragment length equals read adapter length (2x) plus insert size, and insert size equals read lenght (2x) plus inner distance. (FG:0000002)	sequencing	int	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE	
percentageq30	Percentage Q30	Percentage of reads with a Phred quality score over 30, which indicates less than a 1/1000 chance that the base was called incorrectly. (GENEPIO:0000089)	sequencing	decimal	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE
