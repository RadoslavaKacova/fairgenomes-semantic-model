name	label	description	entity	dataType	idAttribute	labelAttribute	visible	nillable	refEntity
SampleprepIdentifier	Sampleprep identifier	A unique proper name or character sequence that identifies this particular sample preparation. (NCIT:C132299)	SamplePreparation	string	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	
BelongsToMaterial	Belongs to material	Reference to the source material from which this sample was prepared. (NCIT:C25683)	SamplePreparation	xref	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE	fair-genomes_Material
InputAmount	Input amount	Amount of input material in nanogram (ng). (AFRL:0000010)	SamplePreparation	int	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE	
LibraryPreparationKit	Library preparation kit	Pre-filled, ready-to-use reagent cartridges intented to improve chemistry, cluster density and read length as well as improve quality (Q) scores for this sample. Reagent components are encoded to interact with the sequencing system to validate compatibility with user-defined applications. (GENEPIO:0000085)	SamplePreparation	xref	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE	fair-genomes_SamplePreparation_LibraryPreparationKit
PcrFree	PCR free	Indicates whether a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to prepare this sample. PCR is a method for amplifying a DNA base sequence using multiple rounds of heat denaturation of the DNA and annealing of oligonucleotide primers complementary to flanking regions in the presence of a heat-stable polymerase. (NCIT:C17003)	SamplePreparation	bool	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE	
TargetEnrichmentKit	Target enrichment kit	Indicates which target enrichment kit was used to prepare this sample. Target enrichment is a pre-sequencing DNA preparation step where DNA sequences are either directly amplified (amplicon or multiplex PCR-based) or captured (hybrid capture-based) in order to only focus on specific regions of a genome or DNA sample. (NCIT:C154307)	SamplePreparation	xref	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE	fair-genomes_SamplePreparation_TargetEnrichmentKit
UmisPresent	UMIs present	Indicates whether any unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) are present. An UMI barcode is a short nucleotide sequence that is used to identify reads originating from an individual mRNA molecule. (EFO:0010199)	SamplePreparation	bool	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE	
IntendedInsertSize	Intended insert size	In paired-end sequencing, the DNA between the adapter sequences is the insert. The length of this sequence is known as the insert size, not to be confused with the inner distance between reads. So, fragment length equals read adapter length (2x) plus insert size, and insert size equals read lenght (2x) plus inner distance. (FG:0000001)	SamplePreparation	int	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE	
IntendedReadLength	Intended read length	The number of nucleotides intended to be ordered from each side of a nucleic acid fragment obtained after the completion of a sequencing process. (NCIT:C153362)	SamplePreparation	int	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE
