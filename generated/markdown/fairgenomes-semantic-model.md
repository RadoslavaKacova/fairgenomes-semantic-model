PCR is a method for amplifying a DNA base sequence using multiple rounds of heat denaturation of the DNA and annealing of oligonucleotide primers complementary to flanking regions in the presence of a heat-stable polymerase. | [NCIT:C17003](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/NCIT_C17003) | Boolean |
| Target enrichment kit | Indicates which target enrichment kit was used to prepare this sample. Target enrichment is a pre-sequencing DNA preparation step where DNA sequences are either directly amplified (amplicon or multiplex PCR-based) or captured (hybrid capture-based) in order to only focus on specific regions of a genome or DNA sample. | [NCIT:C154307](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/NCIT_C154307) | [NGSKits](../../lookups/NGSKits.txt) lookup (616 choices [of type](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/GENEPIO_0000081)) |
| UMIs present | Indicates whether any unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) are present. An UMI barcode is a short nucleotide sequence that is used to identify reads originating from an individual mRNA molecule. | [EFO:0010199](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/efo/EFO_0010199) | Boolean |
| Intended insert size | In paired-end sequencing, the DNA between the adapter sequences is the insert. The length of this sequence is known as the insert size, not to be confused with the inner distance between reads. So, fragment length equals read adapter length (2x) plus insert size, and insert size equals read lenght (2x) plus inner distance. | [FG:0000001](https://w3id.org/fair-genomes/resource/FG_0000001) | Integer |
| Intended read length | The number of nucleotides intended to be ordered from each side of a nucleic acid fragment obtained after the completion of a sequencing process. | [NCIT:C153362](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/NCIT_C153362) | Integer |
