| UMIs present | A unique molecular identifier (UMI) barcode is a short nucleotide sequence that is used to identify reads originating from an individual mRNA molecule. | [EFO:0010199](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/efo/EFO_0010199) | Boolean |
| Intended insert size | In paired-end sequencing, the DNA between the adapter sequences is the insert. The length of this sequence is known as the insert size, not to be confused with the inner distance between reads. So, fragment length equals read adapter length (2x) plus insert size, and insert size equals read lenght (2x) plus inner distance. | [FG:0000001](https://w3id.org/fair-genomes/resource/FG_0000001) | Integer |
| Intended read length | The number of nucleotides successfully ordered from each side of a nucleic acid fragment obtained after the completion of a sequencing process. | [NCIT:C153362](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/NCIT_C153362) | Integer |

## Null flavors
Each lookup in FAIR Genomes is supplemented with so-called 'null flavors' from HL7. These can be used to indicate precisely why a particular value could not be entered into the system, providing substantially more insight than simply leaving a field empty.

| Value | Description | Ontology |
|---|---|---|
| NoInformation | The value is exceptional (missing, omitted, incomplete, improper). No information as to the reason for being an exceptional value is provided. This is the most general exceptional value. It is also the default exceptional value. | [HL7:NI](http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-NullFlavor#NI) |

| Derived | An actual value may exist, but it must be derived from the provided information (usually an EXPR generic data type extension will be used to convey the derivation expression . | [HL7:DER](http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-NullFlavor#DER) |
| Other | The actual value is not a member of the set of permitted data values in the constrained value domain of a variable.The actual value is not a member of the set of permitted data values in the constrained value domain of a variable.

The null flavor would be used to express the quantity of water. | [HL7:QS](http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-NullFlavor#QS) |
