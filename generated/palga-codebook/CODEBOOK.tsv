Other quality metrics	Other NGS quality control metrics, including but not limited to (i) sequencer metrics such as yield, error rate, density (K/mm2), cluster PF (%) and phas/prephas (%), (ii) alignment metrics such as QM insert size, GC content, QM duplicated reads (%), QM error rate, uniformity/evenness of coverage and maternal cell contamination, and (iii) variant call metrics such as number of SNVs/CNVs/SVs called, number of missense/nonsense variants, common variants (%), unique variants (%), gender match and trio inheritance check.
